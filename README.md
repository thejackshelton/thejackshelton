Howdy! 👋

My name's [Jack Shelton](https://jackshelton.com/) a.k.a "the Qwik Astro guy" ✌️. I'm a [Qwik UI](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui) core team member, a design enthusiast, and the creator of the [Astro/Qwik integration](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro).

I'm passionate about performance, accessibility, and working on the next-gen automatically optimized web. 

When I'm not streaming javascript, I love biking and baseball ⚾. Happy to meet up in the Dallas area for a drink or two!
